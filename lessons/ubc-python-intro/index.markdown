## Learning Goals
{% include ubc-python-intro/goals.markdown %}

## Python? What? Why?
{% include ubc-python-intro/why_python.markdown %}

## Digging Deeper
* Basic Python
    * The [python-0-resize-image](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-0-resize-image.ipynb) notebook introduces Python in the context of manipulating image data
    * **TODO** the standalone version of the `novice` module that is destined for the `scikit-image` package needs to be added to this directory
* Functions
  * The [python-1-functions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-1-functions.ipynb) notebook covers defining and calling functions in Python and the call stack
  * **TODO** it is missing a bunch of images about the call stack
* Loops and Indexing
  * The [python-2-loops-indexing](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-2-loops-indexing.ipynb) notebook introduces closed-ended loops, sequences, and slices
  * **TODO** the standalone `ipythonblocks` module needs to be added to this directory
* Conditionals and Defensive Programming
  * The [python-3-conditionals-defensive](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-3-conditionals-defensive.ipynb) notebook introduces Booleans, conditional program flow, defensive programming with `assert` statements, and error handling via exceptions
  * **TODO** it needs to be augmented with the material `try/except` blocks from `swc-python/python-5-testing.ipynb`
* Files and Lists
  * The [python-4-files-lists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-4-files-lists.ipynb) notebook introduces reading text data from files, and using Python's perhaps most used data structure, the `list`.
