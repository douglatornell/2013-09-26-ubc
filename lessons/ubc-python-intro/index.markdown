## Digging In

We're going to interactively work through the collection of IPython notebooks below.
To get the notebooks and all of the supporting files,
please download this [python-intro.zip](python-intro.zip) archive,
and unzip it in the bootcamp repo that you setup during the [Intro to Version Control and Git]({{page.root}}/lessons/ubc-git-intro/index.html) lesson.
Doing that should create a `python-intro` directory that you can add and commit to your repo.

Now `cd` into the `python-intro` directory and launch `ipython notebook`.

* Basic Python
  * The [python-0-resize-image](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-0-resize-image.ipynb) notebook introduces Python in the context of manipulating image data
* Functions
  * The [python-1-functions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-1-functions.ipynb) notebook covers defining and calling functions in Python and the call stack
* Loops and Indexing
  * The [python-2-loops-indexing](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-2-loops-indexing.ipynb) notebook introduces closed-ended loops, sequences, and slices
* Conditionals and Defensive Programming
  * The [python-3-conditionals-defensive](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-3-conditionals-defensive.ipynb) notebook introduces Booleans, conditional program flow, defensive programming with `assert` statements, and error handling via exceptions
* Files and Lists
  * The [python-4-files-lists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-python-intro/python-4-files-lists.ipynb) notebook introduces reading text data from files, and using Python's perhaps most used data structure, the `list`.
