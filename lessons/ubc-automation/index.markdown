## Automation Notebooks

Create and switch to a new `automation` branch in your repo.
Create an `automation` directory and copy the `climate_data.py` file into it.
Start `ipython notebook` in your `automation` directory.

The notebooks we're going to work through are:

- [automation-0-requests](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-automation/automation-0-requests.ipynb):
using the [requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/) to get data from web sites
- [automation-1-args](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-automation/automation-1-args.ipynb):
creating a Python module that can be both used for imports and run from the command line,
and handling command line arguments in Python
- [automation-2-shell](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-automation/automation-2-shell.ipynb):
writing shell scripts to execute shell commands and/or Python scripts and using `at` and `cron` to defer and repeat execution of those scripts

The notebooks and supporting files for this lesson are available in this [automation.zip](automation.zip) archive.
