##Planing Notes
<ul>
  <li>Intro to SciPy, or maybe Pandas</li>
  <li>Histogram plots of rainfall data, statistical tests to find a distribution that models the data</li>
  <li>Curve fitting to model daily and seasonal temperature variation</li>
  <li>An alternative or addition would be do data visualization by plotting on maps, but different, geocoded data would probably be required.</li>
</ul>
