##Planning Notes
<ul>
  <li>Compile a repo containing all of the hourly and daily YVR data that people downloaded and explored on Thu</li>
  <li>Merge the data into long timeseries of hourly quantities and daily rainfall; 6 groups doing a different quantity each</li>
  <li>Contribute the timeseries to the repo</li>
  <li>How does branching, merging, and (maybe) rebasing get covered?</li>
</ul>
