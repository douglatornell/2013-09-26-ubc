## Code Design and Testing

Create and switch to a new `testing` branch in your repo.
Create an `testing` directory and copy the `climate_data.py` from your `automation` directory file into it.
Start `ipython notebook` in your `testing` directory.

The notebook we're going to work through is:

- [testing-0-unit-tests](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/douglatornell.github.io/2013-09-26-ubc/lessons/ubc-testing/testing-0-unit-tests.ipynb):

  - writing Python code to test our Python code
  - using [pytest] to automatically find, run, and report test results
  - using [coverage] to measure and report on unit test coverage of code
  - ideas about how to set up automated baseline testing

Most of the exercises will be done in your editor and at the command line.

[pytest]: http://pytest.org/latest/
[coverage]: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

The notebook for this lesson is available in this [testing.zip](testing.zip) archive.
