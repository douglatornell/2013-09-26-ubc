##Planning Notes
<ul>
  <li>Readability, modularity, correctness, robustness; ref: <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/08/intecol13-good-code.html">http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/08/intecol13-good-code.html</a></li>
  <li>Writing and running tests, test automation</li>
  <li>Exercise based on 6 x 4 groups writing code and tests for descriptive statistics function: mean, median, mode, range, quantiles, variance or std deviation</li>
  <li>Groups submit their results as github pull requests; if there's time, perhaps explore code review</li>
  <li>Demo the role of tests in refactoring by collapsing median into quantiles with n=2</li>
</ul>
