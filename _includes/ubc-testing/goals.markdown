2. Use the [pytest] tool to automatically discover, run, and report on unit test results.
3. Explain the idea of baseline testing and how to automate it.
4. Explain how modular code design, and the concepts of readability, encapsulation, and testability all contribute to the creation of robust, reusable code.
